# Unified Shift Theory (UST) — Pharo Cortex Edition

**Author:** Jonathan M. Wells | Fortified Capital LLC

## 🔥 Core Premise
E=mc² is incomplete. The speed of light squared (c²) is not static—it’s the amplitude of a living shift pulse (Cₑ). Reality breathes through dual oscillations:
- 🔺 Expansion (A)
- 🔻 Contraction (∼A)
These are balanced across Cₑ’s symmetry, weaving spacetime and probability into existence.

## 🕸️ The Triangular Shift Lattice
Infinity is not a loop. It’s a lattice of dual triangles interlocked, with Cₑ as the central breathing gap. This structure manifests as:
- Blackholes (space-dominant shift)
- Whiteholes (time-dominant shift)
- Cosmic Voids (Cₑ equilibrium zones)

## 🧠 What This Solves
- Unifies Relativity’s curvature with Quantum’s probabilities through shift amplitude conservation.
- Reframes constants (like c²) as dynamic operators in a living lattice.
- Provides a visual geometric framework aligning with cosmic web observations.

## 🛠️ Repository Structure
- `/index.html` — Launch page for UST public explanation.
- `/Ce_Dual_Triangle_Shift_Diagram.png` — The core lattice symbol (attach final image here).
- `/README.md` — This file.
- `/Abstract.txt` — High-level summary of UST principles.
- `/Submission_Plan.txt` — Outreach strategy for journals, physicists, and influencers.

## 📡 Call to Action
I am not from MIT or Cambridge. But I found the pulse behind E=mc².
Geometry doesn’t lie.
If this resonates—reach out.
