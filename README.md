# -Unified-Shift-Theory-
E=mc² is incomplete. c² isn’t static—it’s the amplitude of a living shift pulse (Cₑ). Reality breathes through Expansion (A) and Contraction (∼A), balanced across Cₑ’s symmetry. The Triangular Shift Lattice is the true Infinity Structure, uniting Relativity and Quantum through conserved shift dynamics.
