Unified Shift Theory (UST): The Cₑ Pulse as the Origin of Relativity-Quantum Duality

UST proposes that the bridge between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics is a dynamic, self-referential constant (Cₑ). This rhythmic shift modulates dualities into spacetime curvature and quantum superpositions through a triangular shift lattice.
